// Because of the nature of most graphic editors, the world still revolves around pixels
// Thus, it's much easier to "think" in pixels when sizing stuff, but still be able to use scalable units
// This function allows you to convert a value from pixels to a relative unit (defaults to em)
// The conversion is based on the $base-size variable
